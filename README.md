# Chemical-Kinetic-Reactors

### Use the experimental data to find rate curves against concentrations and conversions
### Find the best fit rate expression for given data and provide solution by both graphical and analytical approach
### Design algorithms for wide variety of reactors like MFR, Plug flow and their different combinations. Obtain the optimal size of reactor and residence time for given conditions and visualize the results.

### One of the example which has been solved efficiently by above algorithm:

<p>In the presence of a specific enzyme E, which acts as a homogeneous catalyst, a harmful organic A present in industrial waste water degrades into harmless chemicals. A t a given enzyme concentration Ce, tests in a laboratory mixed flow reactor give the following results:</p>

<p>Co(mmol/m3): 2 5 6 6 11 14 16 24 </p>
<p>Ca(mmol/m3)  0.5 3 1 2 6  10 8 4 </p>
<p>tou(min)  30 1 50 8 4 20 20 4</p>
<p>We wish to treat 0.1 m3/min of this waste water having Co = 10 mmol/m3 to 90% conversion with this enzyme at concentration Ce</p>
<p>(a) One possibility is to use a long tubular reactor (assume plug flow) with possible recycle of exit fluid. What design do you recommend? Give the size of the reactor, tell if it should be used with recycle, and if so determine the recycle flow rate in cubic meters per minute (m3/min). Sketch your recommended design.</p>
<p>(b) Another possibility is to use one or two stirred tanks (assume ideal). What two-tank design do you recommend, and how much better is it than the one-tank arrangement?</p>
<p>(c) What arrangement of plug flow and mixed flow reactors would you use to minimize the total volume of reactors needed? Sketch your recommended design and show the size of units selected. We should mention that separa- tion and recycle of part of the product stream is not allowed.</p>
